Another day in the kitchen this weekend calls for another delicacy from my childhood! Samosa and
Balushahi were a great combination of savory and sweet things to have on any great occasion!

In the [last post](/blog/samosa-recipe), we learned to make
[Samosas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samosa), in this one, we are going to
prepare [Balushahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balushahi)!

[Balushahi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balushahi) is a very simple sweet, very much like
donoughts! It is similar to a glazed doughnut in terms of ingredients, but differs in texture and
taste. In South India, a similar pastry is known as **badushah**.

## Ingredients

- 2 cups all-purpose flour (maida)
- 1/4 cup ghee (purified butter) or just plain unsalted butter
- 1/4 cup fresh yogurt
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 pinch baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 8-9 tablespoon cold water for kneading
- 1 heaped cup sugar
- 1/cup additional water
- 1/2 to 1 teaspoon cardamom powder
- A few drops of lemon juice, _optional_
- oil/ghee for deep frying, as required
- 100 gm pistachio, _optional_

## Preparation

### Balushahi Dough

- Take 1/4 cup ghee/butter in a bowl.
- With a spoon, spatula or a small wired whisk, beat it until it is smooth, light and fluffy.
- Add 1/4 cup yogurt, and keep it whisking until light and smooth.
- Add 2 cups of all-purpose flour (maida) in the same bowl.
- Add 1 pinch salt, 1 pinch baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon baking powder.
- Mix the flour lightly using a spoon.
- Sprinkle some cold water in parts and begin to mix. Overall, do not use more than 8-9 tablespoons
  of cold water. Add only 2-3 tablespoons at a time.
- Mix and combine everything to form a soft dough. Do not knead!
- Cover the dough and keep aside for about 15 minutes.
- Use light pressure from hands and form a dough.

### Sugar Syrup

- While keeping aside the dough, prepare sugar syrup.
- Take 1 cup sugar in a pan and add 1/2 cup water and mix.
- Place the pan on low flame.
- Using a spoon stir the sugar so that it dissolves. When all sugar has dissolved, add cardamom
  powder, keep stirring.
- Optionally, to avoid crystallization of sugar, you can add few drops of lemon juice!
- The syrup should be sticky. Cool it in a spoon and keep testing while its on low heat. Once done
  switch off the heat, and keep the syrup aside.

### Frying Balushahi

- Add balushahi in pan one by one and fry until golden brown and crisp.
- Drain extra oil on paper towel.
