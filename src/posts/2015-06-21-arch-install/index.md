You must be thinking - yet another installation guide! There is no dearth of _Installation_ guides
of Arch on web. So why another one?

With advancements like BTRFS file system, UEFI motherboards and modern _in-development_ desktop
environment like Plasma 5; traditional
[Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide) guide and
[Arch Beginners' Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide) can only be of a
limited help. After I got [my new desktop](/my-desktop), my goal was to setup it with a _modern_
setup. I decided to go with Arch Linux with _btrfs_ file system and Plasma 5 desktop. Coming from
OSX, I just love how far _linux_ has come in terms of looks - _quite close to OSX!_

I will cover this in two parts. First in this post, I will install the base system. Then, in a
follow up post, I will discuss details of setting up final working Plasma 5 desktop.

## Initial Setup

Download the latest iso from Arch website and create the uefi usb installation media. I used my mac
to do this on terminal:

```shell

diskutil list
diskutil unmountDisk /dev/disk1
dd if=image.iso of=/dev/rdisk1 bs=1m
20480+0 records in
20480+0 records out
167772160 bytes transferred in 220.016918 secs (762542 bytes/sec)

diskutil eject /dev/disk1

```

Use this media to boot into your machine. You should boot into UEFI mode if you have a
[UEFI](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface) motherboard and
UEFI mode enabled.

To verify you have booted in UEFU mode, run:

```shell
efivar -l
```

This should give you a list of set UEFI variables. Please look at the
[Begineers' Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Beginners%27_guide) in case you do not get
any list of UEFI variables.

### Ethernet/Wifi

Ethernet should have started by default on your machine. If you do not plan to use wifi during
installation, you can skip to the next section. If desired later, wifi will still be configurable
after you are done with all the installation.

To setup wifi simply run:

```shell
wifi-menu
```

This is a pretty straight forward tool and will setup wifi for you for this installation session.

This will also create a file at _/etc/netctl/_. We will use this file later to enable wifi at the
first session after installation.

### System Updates

For editing different configurations, I tend to use _vim_. So we will update our package cache and
install vim.

```shell
pacman -Syy
pacman -S vim
```

### Hard Drives

In my desktop, I have three hard drives, one 256 GB solid state drive (SDD), one 1 TB HDD and
another 3TB HDD. I set up my drives as follows: -SDD for _root(/)_, _/boot_, and _/home_
partitions, 1st HDD for _/data_ and the 2nd HDD for _/media_ partitions.

For UEFI machines, we need to use a GPT partition table and _/boot_ partition has to be a fat32
partition with a minimum size of 512 MB. We will format rest other partitions with BTRFS. See this
[link](https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/ext4-btrfs-making-switch-linux/) for benefits of using _btrfs_
partitions.

First list your hard drives with the following:

```shell
lsblk
cat /proc/partitions
```

Assuming, my setup above, now create gpt partitions and format them.

```shell
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=1M count=5000
gdisk /dev/sda
Found invalid MBR and corrupt GPT. What do you want to do? (Using the
GPT MAY permit recovery of GPT data.)
 1 - Use current GPT
 2 - Create blank GPT
```

Then press 2 to create a blank GPT and start fresh

```shell
ZAP:
press x - to go to extended menu
press z - to zap
press Y - to confirm
press Y - to delete MBR
```

It might now kick us out of _gdisk_, so get back into it:

```shell
gdisk /dev/sda

Command (? for help): m
Command (? for help): n

Partition number (1-128, default 1):
First sector (34-500118158, default = 2048) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (2048-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}: 512M
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300): ef00
Changed type of partition to 'EFI System'

Partition number (2-128, default 2):
First sector (34-500118, default = 16779264) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Last sector (16779264-500118, default = 500118) or {+-}size{KMGTP}:
Current type is 'Linux filesystem'
Hex code or GUID (L to show codes, Enter = 8300):
Changed type of partition to 'Linux filesystem'

Command (? for help): p
Press w to write to disk
Press Y to confirm
```

Repeat the above procedure for _/dev/sdb_ and _/dev/sdc_, but create just one partition with all
values as default. At the end we will have three partitions: _/dev/sda1, /dev/sda2, /dev/sdb1_ and
_/dev/sdc1_

Now we will format these partitions.

```shell
mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda1
mkfs.btrfs -L arch /dev/sda2
mkfs.btrfs -L data /dev/sdb1
mkfs.btrfs -L media /dev/sdc1
```

Now, we will create btrfs subvolumes and mount them properly for installation and final setup.

```shell
mount /dev/sda2 /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/ROOT
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/home
umount /mnt

mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/data
umount /mnt

mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt
btrfs subvolume create /mnt/media
umount /mnt
```

Now, once the sub-volumes have been created, we will mount them in appropriate locations with
optimal flags.

```shell
$SSD_MOUNTS="rw,noatime,nodev,compress=lzo,ssd,discard,
    space_cache,autodefrag,inode_cache"
HDD_MOUNTS="rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,space_cache"
EFI_MOUNTS="rw,noatime,discard,nodev,nosuid,noexec"
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,subvol=ROOT /dev/sda2 /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/home
mkdir -p /mnt/data
mkdir -p /mnt/media
mount -o $SSD_MOUNTS,nosuid,subvol=home /dev/sda2 /mnt/home
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS,subvol=data /dev/sdb1 /mnt/data
mount -o $HDD_MOUNTS,subvol=media /dev/sdc1 /mnt/media

mkdir -p /mnt/boot
mount -o $EFI_MOUNTS /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
```

### Base Installation

Now, we will do the actually installation of base packages.

```shell
pacstrap /mnt base base-devel btrfs-progs
genfstab -U -p /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

Edit the /mnt/ect/fstab file to add following /tmp mounts.

```shell
tmpfs /tmp tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid 0 0
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0 0
```

> Copy our current _wifi_ setup file into the new system. This will enable _wifi_ at first boot.
> Next, _chroot_ into our newly installed system.

Finally bind root for installation.

```shell
arch-chroot /mnt /bin/bash
```

### Basic Setup

Here are some basic commands you need to run to get the installation started.

```shell
pacman -Syy
pacman -S sudo vim
vim /etc/locale.gen

...
# en_SG ISO-8859-1
en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8
# en_US ISO-8859-1
...

locale-gen
echo LANG=en_US.UTF-8 > /etc/locale.conf
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
ls -l /usr/share/zoneinfo
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Zone/SubZone /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc --utc
sed -i "s/# %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL/" /etc/sudoers
HOSTNAME=euler
echo $HOSTNAME > /etc/hostname
pacman -S dosfstools efibootmgr
sed -i 's/^\(HOOKS=.*fsck\)\(.*$\)/\1 btrfs\2/g' /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
mkinitcpio -p linux
passwd
```

We will also add _hostname_ to our /etc/hosts file:

```shell
vim /etc/hosts
...
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost $HOSTNAME
::1             localhost.localdomain   localhost $HOSTNAME
...
```

### Bootloader Setup

_systemd-boot_, previously called _gummiboot_, is a simple UEFI boot manager which executes
configured EFI images. The default entry is selected by a configured pattern (glob) or an on-screen
menu. It is included with the _systemd_, which is installed on an Arch systems by default.

Assuming _/boot_ is your boot drive, first run the following command to get started:

```shell
bootctl --path=/boot install
```

It will copy the systemd-boot binary to your EFI System Partition (
`/boot/EFI/systemd/systemd-bootx64.efi` and `/boot/EFI/Boot/BOOTX64.EFI` - both of which are
identical - on x64 systems ) and add systemd-boot itself as the default EFI application (default
boot entry) loaded by the EFI Boot Manager.

Finally to configure out boot loader, we will need the UUID of out root drive (_/dev/sda2_). You
can find that by:

```shell
lsblk -no NAME,UUID /dev/sda2
```

Now, make sure that the following two files look as follows, where \$UUID is the value obtained
from above command:

```shell
vim /boot/loader/loader.conf
...
timeout 3
default arch
...
vim /boot/loader/entries/arch.conf
...

title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options root=UUID=$UUID rw rootfstype=btrfs rootflags=subvol=ROOT
...
```

> Please note that you will to need manually run `bootctl` command every time `systemd-boot` gets
> updated.

### Network Setup

First setup hostname using _systemd_:

```shell
hostnamectl set-hostname $HOSTNAME
```

Check the "Ethernet controller" entry (or similar) from the `lspci -v` output. It should tell you
which kernel module contains the driver for your network device. For example:

```shell
lspci -v
$
...
04:00.0 Ethernet controller: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller (rev 11)
        Subsystem: ASUSTeK Computer Inc. Device 859e
        Flags: bus master, fast devsel, latency 0, IRQ 29
        I/O ports at d000 [size=256]
        Memory at f7100000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=4K]
        Memory at f2100000 (64-bit, prefetchable) [size=16K]
        Capabilities: <access denied>
        Kernel driver in use: r8169
        Kernel modules: r8169
...
$
```

Next, check that the driver was loaded via `dmesg | grep module_name`. For example:

```shell
dmesg | grep r8169
$
...
[    3.215178] r8169 Gigabit Ethernet driver 2.3LK-NAPI loaded
[    3.215185] r8169 0000:04:00.0: can't disable ASPM; OS doesn't have ASPM control
[    3.220477] r8169 0000:04:00.0 eth0: RTL8168g/8111g at 0xffffc90000c74000, 78:24:af:d7:1d:3d, XID 0c000800 IRQ 29
[    3.220481] r8169 0000:04:00.0 eth0: jumbo features [frames: 9200 bytes, tx checksumming: ko]
[    3.226949] r8169 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: renamed from eth0
[    5.128713] r8169 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: link down
[    5.128713] r8169 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: link down
[    8.110869] r8169 0000:04:00.0 enp4s0: link up
...
$
```

Proceed if the driver was loaded successfully. Otherwise, you will need to know which module is
needed for your particular model. Please follow the
[Arch Wiki Networking](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Network_configuration) guide for
further assistance.

Get current device names via `/sys/class/net` or `ip link`. For example:

```shell
ls /sys/class/net
$
...
enp4s0  lo  wlp3s0
...
$
ip link
$
...
2: enp4s0: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP> mtu 1500 qdisc fq_codel state UP mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
    link/ether 78:24:af:d7:1d:3d brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
...
$
```

Using this name of the device, we need to configure, enable following two systemd services:
_systemd-networkd.service_ and _systemd-resolved.service_.

For compatibility with resolv.conf, delete or rename the existing file and create the following
symbolic link:

```shell
ln -s /usr/lib/systemd/resolv.conf /etc/resolv.conf
```

Network configurations are stored as \*.network in _/etc/systemd/network_. We need to create ours
as follows.:

```shell
vim /etc/systemd/network/wired.network
$
...
[Match]
Name=enp4s0

[Network]
DHCP=ipv4

...

$
```

Now enable these services:

```shell
systemctl enable systemd-resolved.service
systemctl enable systemd-networkd.service
```

Your network should be ready for first use!

### First Boot

Now we are ready for the first boot! Run the following command:

```shell
exit
umount -R /mnt
reboot
```

Awesome! We are ready to play with our new system. Alas! what you have is just a basic installation
without any GUI.

Please see my [next post](/blog/plasma-install-guide) for where to go next!
