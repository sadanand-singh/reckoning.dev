Last month or so has been all silent here. No puzzles, no math, no computers and most important, no
Food! And as usual blame is on my work schedule.

Yes, the silence is finally over, and what's better than giving your taste buds some rejuvenation
after some long busy weeks at work. Continuing with my healthy but tasty choices, today I tried to
cook _Palak_ (Spinach) with _Paneer_.

_Palak_ _Paneer_ is a common north Indian cuisine, Indian cottage cheese cooked in spinach puree.
Its a bit involved than my last few dishes. Nevertheless, I promise you - the "yummy-ness" of this
one is worth all the trouble!
