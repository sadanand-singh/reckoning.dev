In my last post on [Arch Installation Guide](/blog/arch-install) , We installed the base system and we
can now login into our new system as root using the password that we set.

{% callout "action" %}
Please see [my latest post](/blog/complete-setup-arch-gnome) on installing Arch linux with Gnome 3 for
an upto date version of this guide.
{% endcallout %}

Now, we will proceed further to install the Plasma 5 desktop.

## Add New User

Choose `$USERNAME` per your liking. I chose `ssingh`, so in future commands whenever you see
`ssingh` please replace it with your `$USERNAME`.

```shell
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/bash $USERNAME
chfn --full-name "$FULL_NAME" $USERNAME
passwd $USERNAME
```

## Plasma 5 Desktop

Network should be setup at the start. Check the status of network using:

```shell
ping google.com -c 2
$
PING google.com (10.38.24.84) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.022 ms
64 bytes from google.com (10.38.24.84): icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.023 ms
$
--- google.com ping statistics ---
2 packets transmitted, 2 received, 0% packet loss, time 999ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.022/0.022/0.023/0.004 ms
$
```

If you do not get this output, please follow the troubleshooting links at
[arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/systemd-networkd) on setting up network.

I will be assuming you have an NVIDIA card for graphics installation.

To setup a graphical desktop, first we need to install some basic X related packages, and some
_essential_ packages (including fonts):

```shell
pacman -S xorg-server xorg-server-utils nvidia nvidia-libgl
```

To avoid the possibility of forgetting to update your _initramfs_ after an _nvidia_ upgrade, you
have to use a _pacman_ hook like this:

```shell
vim /etc/pacman.d/hooks/nvidia.hook
$
...
[Trigger]
Operation=Install
Operation=Upgrade
Operation=Remove
Type=Package
Target=nvidia

[Action]
Depends=mkinitcpio
When=PostTransaction
Exec=/usr/bin/mkinitcpio -p linux
...
$
```

Nvidia has a daemon that is to be run at boot. To start the persistence daemon at boot, enable the
`nvidia-persistenced.service`.

```shell
systemctl enable nvidia-persistenced.service
systemctl start nvidia-persistenced.service
```

### KWIN FLICKERING ISSUE

To avoid screen tearing in KDE (KWin), add following:

```shell
vim /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh
$
...
export __GL_YIELD="USLEEP"
...
```

If this does not help please try adding the following instead -

```shell
vim /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh
$
...
export KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=1
...
```

> **Do not have both of the above enabled at the same time. Please look at
> [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/NVIDIA/Troubleshooting) for additional
> details.**

Now continue installing remaining important packages for the GUI.

```shell
pacman -S mesa ttf-hack ttf-anonymous-pro
pacman -S tlp tlp-rdw acpi_call bash-completion git meld
pacman -S ttf-dejavu ttf-freefont ttf-liberation
```

Now, we will install the packages related to Plasma 5:

```shell
pacman -S plasma-meta kf5 kdebase kdeutils kde-applications
pacman -S kdegraphics gwenview
```

Now we have to setup a display manager. I chose recommended SDDM for plasma 5.

```shell
pacman -S sddm sddm-kcm
vim /etc/sddm.conf

...
[Theme]
# Current theme name
Current=breeze

# Cursor theme
CursorTheme=breeze_cursors
...

systemctl enable sddm
```

Also make sure that network manager starts at boot:

```shell
systemctl disable dhcpcd.service
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

## Audio Setup

This is pretty simple. Install following packages and you should be done:

```shell
pacman -S alsa-utils pulseaudio pulseaudio-alsa libcanberra-pulse
pacman -S libcanberra-gstreamer jack2-dbus kmix
pacman -S mpv mplayer
```

## Useful Tips

This part is optional and you can choose as per your taste. Sync time using the `systemd` service:

```shell
vim /etc/systemd/timesyncd.conf
$
...
[Time]
NTP=0.arch.pool.ntp.org 1.arch.pool.ntp.org 2.arch.pool.ntp.org 3.arch.pool.ntp.org
FallbackNTP=0.pool.ntp.org 1.pool.ntp.org 0.fr.pool.ntp.org
...
$
timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl status
$
...
      Local time: Tue 2016-09-20 16:40:44 PDT
  Universal time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44 UTC
        RTC time: Tue 2016-09-20 23:40:44
       Time zone: US/Pacific (PDT, -0700)
 Network time on: yes
NTP synchronized: yes
 RTC in local TZ: no
 ...
$
```

On Plasma 5, It is recommended to enable no-bitmaps to improve the font rendering:

```shell
sudo ln -s /etc/fonts/conf.avail/70-no-bitmaps.conf
   /etc/fonts/conf.d
```

If you use vim as your primary editor, you may find this [vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc)
quite useful.

That's It. You are done. Start playing your new beautiful desktop. Please leave your comments with
suggestions or any word of appreciation if this has been of any help to you.
