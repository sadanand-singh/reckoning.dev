Given an alphanumeric string, find the shortest substring that occurs exactly once as a
(contiguous) substring in it. Overlapping occurrences are counted as distinct. If there are several
candidates of the same length, you must output all of them in the order of occurrence. The _space_
is NOT considered as a valid non-repeating substring.

## Examples

Consider the following cases:

**Case 1:** If the given string is `asdfsasa`, the answer should be `['d', 'f']`

**Case 2:** If the given string is `sadanands`,

the answer should be `['sa', 'ad', 'da', 'na', 'nd', 'ds']`

**Case 3:** If the given string is `wwwwwwww`, the answer should be `['wwwwwwww']`

## My Solution

Here is my solution in _Python_.

It is quite brute force. I am not sure about the order of `find()` and `rfind()` built-in methods
in _Python_. Assuming these are $O(n)$, my algorithm is in $O(n^3)$. Please put your answers in
comments below, if your answer has a better scaling.

The function definition that I use for finding non-empty non-repeating strings is _recursive_.

```python
def findNsubString(s, n):
    subS = []
    for index in range(len(s)+1):
        x = s[index:index+n]
        if s.find(x) == s.rfind(x):
            subS.append(x)
    if subS:
        return subS
    else:
        return findNsubString(s, n+1)
```

I call this method as follows to get the desired results:

```python
#! /usr/bin/python
import argparse
# Parse Command Line Arguments
parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
parser.add_argument("-s", "--string", default = "asda", help="Input")
args = parser.parse_args()
s = args.string
# Call Method to find smallest non-repeating sub-string
ans = findNsubString(s, 1)
print(ans)
```

A similar solution can also be written in `JAVA` or `C++`. The corresponding `find()` and `rfind()`
methods in JAVA are called `indexOf()` and `lastIndexOf()`, respectively. In C++, these methods are
called same as in Python.

Please feel free to put your method definition in any programming language.
