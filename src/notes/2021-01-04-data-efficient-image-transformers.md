Image classification — the task of understanding the main content of an image — is easy for humans
but hard for machines. In particular, it is challenging for convolution-free Transformers like DeiT
because these systems don’t have many statistical priors about images: They typically have to “see”
a lot of example images in order to learn to classify different objects. DeiT, however, can be
trained effectively with 1.2 million images, rather than requiring hundreds of millions of images.
