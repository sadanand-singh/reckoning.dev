Traditional computer vision models typically use a complex, partly handcrafted pipeline that relies
on custom layers in order to localize objects in an image and then extract features. DETR replaces
this with a simpler neural network that offers a true end-to-end deep learning solution to the
problem. (via [@reckoningdev](https://twitter.com/reckoningdev))
