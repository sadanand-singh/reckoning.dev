Hi, I'm **Sadanand Singh**. I build AI models in medical imaging and enjoy working with Algorithms,
Python/C++, and medical and biological data. My background is in computational physics, numerical
modeling and optimization and software design. I have a PhD in computational physics/chemical
engineering focusing on computational models of nano-materials and bio-molecules.

My active area of research is in applications of deep learning and computer vision in medical
imaging and in the radiology business. I am specifically interested in designing AI models that are explainable and
tractable.
