And it's that time of year again! Most of you must have started planning for a brand new year and a
new decade. Keeping up with that spirit, this post is about my plans and expectations regarding
this blog space for the upcoming new year.

Its been almost 5 years since I started this blog. Those of you who have been following me here,
would be aware, this has not been easy to follow at all. With frequent changes in the design,
theme, web address (from github pages to datasciencevision.com to the current reckoning.dev!) and
underlying technological changes ([pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to
[nikola](https://getnikola.com/) to [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to
[gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)!). The very first promise I want to make in the 2020 is to
guarantee the stability of this space.

- [reckoning.dev](https://reckoning.dev/) address is going to stay for long, its been paid for the
  next 5 years!
- The current looks/theme (thanks to the work of [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/))
  along with the underlying tech of gatsby, mdx and react is something I have fallen in love with.

### 2019: A Brief Summary

A year is a long time. Still, when I look at my blogging history, this has been the year with one
of the lowest number of posts. Unfortunately - or fortunately - I'm learning so much, so fast, that
I haven't been able to write about it all. But at least I can track it here, and try my best to get
a resource out into the world for my own reference and to help others. Following is a brief summary
of my 2019:

**Top 5 things that I learnt this year:**

- javascript, react, gatsby, css etc.
- [mlflow](https://mlflow.org/) for managing deep learning experiments
- mixed precision training in pytorch
- Writing user-defined algorithms as pytorch modules in CUDA
- Designing complete python library: Developed a pytorch based high level training/inference engine
  to train models with medical imaging data.

**Top 5 things I developed this year:**

- Pytorch based high level library for training deep learning models on medical imaging data.
- Flask apps to create APIs for controlling SLURM jobs via web.
- Model zoo API and database using mongodb for management of models.
- Command line tools to submit and manage jobs on a compute cluster.
- Weakly supervised learning models for breast cancer.

**Top 5 Books I read:**

- [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood:_Secrets_and_Lies_in_a_Silicon_Valley_Startup)
  by John Carreyrou
- [The Emperor of All Maladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emperor_of_All_Maladies) by
  Siddhartha Mukherjee
- [Brief Answers to the Big Questions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brief_Answers_to_the_Big_Questions)
  by Stephen Hawking
- [The Patient will See you Now](https://www.amazon.com/Patient-Will-See-You-Now/dp/0465040020) by
  Eric Topol
- [The Master Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm) by Pedro Domingos

**My Incomplete Tasks and Failures:**

- Object detection for extremely imbalanced data and loose bounding boxes.
- Generative models for breast mammogram data
- A GUI for debugging of deep learning models on medical images
- A markdown editor/preview app for OSX

### 2020: New year, New Promises

With the beginning of a new year, I want to make few new promises to myself. In no particular
order, following are list of things I want to do/learn/complete in this year.

I'm starting an email list for people interested in AI development and programming in general.
If you enjoy that kind of stuff, you can join here and I'll notify you whenever I publish a new post.
No strings attached, unsubscribe anytime.
